# FileConverter
To use through the terminal, input the following commands in your terminal then run the file:
 - pip3 install Pillow pillow-heif PyPDF2

You can convert HEIF, JPEG, and PNG files to each other, HEIF, JPEG, AND PNG files to PDF (not vice versa), and also merge pdf files together.

You can also convert MP4, MOV, and GIF files to each other as well as isolating/adding audio to video.

It is crucial that you do not misspell any commands, as any error will mess it up. There are little to no safety measures in this program because I'm lazy.

All files will be found in the output folder, DO NOT MOVE OR RENAME THAT FOLDER.

Thanks for using! Enjoy!
