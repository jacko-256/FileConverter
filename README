                    FILE AND PDF CONVERTER/MERGER - BY JACKSON ADAMS

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use through the terminal, input the following commands in your terminal:
 - pip3 install Pillow pillow-heif PyPDF2

Now to launch the file, enter: 
 - cd [insert enclosing folder's file path]
 - python3 [insert script's file path]

My command is: cd /Users/jacksonadams1/VSCode/FileConverter
               python3 imagetoascii.py
	           (You can replace for convenience)

So far, you can convert HEIF, JPEG, and PNG files to each other, HEIF, JPEG, AND PNG
files to PDF (not vice versa), and also merge pdf files together.

It is crucial that you do not misspell any commands, as any error will mess it up. There
are little to no safety measures in this program because I'm lazy.

All files will be found in the output folder, DO NOT MOVE OR RENAME THAT FOLDER.

Thanks for using! Enjoy!						                             10/10/2024
